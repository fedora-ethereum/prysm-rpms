# REMOVE BEFORE SUBMITTING THIS FOR REVIEW

# New Fedora packages should use %%gometa -f, which makes the package
# ExclusiveArch to %%golang_arches_future and thus excludes the package from
# %%ix86. If the new package is needed as a dependency for another pacage,
# please consider removing that package from %%ix86 in the same way, instead of
# building more go packages for i686. If your package is not a leaf package,
# you'll need to coordinate the removal of the package's dependents first.
